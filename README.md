# Receipts Reader
Did you know that you can see all your receipts from shops where you've swiped your clubcard on the [New World Clubcard website](https://www.clubcard.co.nz/newworld/en/activity/transactions)?
In the browser version, they're stored as PDFs, which this script reads and processes.

## Future Plans
This started off as a tool to help with budgeting but I'm hoping to explore ways to track the price increases of items as well.

## To Do
- Find a way to store the data without duplicates (currently loading everything in each time I use the script)
- Draw more cool graphs
